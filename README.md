# Natural Language Processing Models Implementation

This repository is a collection of Natural Language Processing models implemented using Python. Major topics covered include properties of human language at different levels of representation (morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics), and how to create systems that can analyze, understand, and generate natural language; core NLP techniques for language modeling, tagging, parsing, word-sense disambiguation and image caption generation;  machine learning methods used in NLP, such as various forms of Neural Networks, Bayesian networks, and Hidden Markov Models. 

The collection of Natural Language Processing models are:

3. [Dependency Parsing with Neural Networks](/Dependency%20Parsing%20with%20Neural%20Networks)
4. [Lexical Substitution](/Lexical%20Substitution)
5. [Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators](/Image%20Captioning%20with%20Conditioned%20LSTM%20Generators)
